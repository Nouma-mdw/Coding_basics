# Welcome to the Coding_basics wiki!

The intention of this python repository is to deliver a quick overview
that allows you to review concepts you haven't used in a while but require for your actual prohject and get you going as soon as possible.
So far the following topics are planned:
- Big O notation and relevance for choice of function (with loops, nested loops, recursive, other?)
- function, class methods and overhead
- sorting and search algorithms

Right now I'm working on, "Big O notation..."

any suggestions?



# Progress status on:

## Big O notation:
### 1. The plan:
### 2. The actual progress:
### 3. How has it been useful to you?

### 1. The plan:
1.1. Deliver a quick review on the concepts with practical "trials".
1.2. Rank different types of codes (functions with loops, functions with nested loops, recursive functions, and maybe others?) according to their time complexity (Big O notation) and describe their main application for easy decision making when choosing how to design you code.

### 2. The actual progress:
2.1. Three trials for a quick concept review are given.
The first part of the code is structured to make a clear distinctions between execution time (Trial 2) and the number of times a statement gets executed (Trial 2).
The choice of code and the formulation might still be confusing.

2.2. Sorry guys, these are still loose ends I have to sort.

### 3. How has it been useful to you?
So far of no use to anyone yet.
